# Krylov Subspace Methods For Solving Large Matrices
This repository contains my introduction notes to various Krylov subspace methods( including Lanczos, Arnoldi, Krylov-Schur, GMRES, MinRes and conjugate gradient methods) for solving and eigen-solving large matrices which are suitable for large-scale parallel computation.

If you want to reference some runnable codes, I highly recommend my repository `Althea` (which is currently being developed and will be published soon). You can find most of the implementations of main text in `Althea.Backend.CSharp.Solver.Krylov.KrylovBased.cs` and the ones of Chapter 0 in `Althea.Backend.CSharp.LinearAlgebra.MatrixSolvers.cs`, whose comments contains a number of TeX equations which can be shown by extension tools like TeX Comments.
