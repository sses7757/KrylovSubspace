## Section 1 Notations

The sets are represented by upper script letters like $\mathscr{L}$.

The scalars are represented by lower greek letters like $\alpha$ã€‚

The vectors are represented by lower english (or greek) letters with arrows like $\vec{x}$, whose elements are represented by corresponding letters without arrows and a subscript like $x_{i}$. The notation $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{F}^{m}$ means that $\vec{x}$ is a vector with $m$ elements of field $\mathbb{F}$:
$$\vec{x} \in \mathbb{F}^{m} \Leftrightarrow \vec{x}=\begin{bmatrix}
x_{1} \\
 \vdots \\
x_{m} \\
\end{bmatrix};\quad x_{1},\ldots,x_{m}\in \mathbb{F}$$

The matrices are represented by upper english (or greek) letters like $A$ and $\Lambda$, whose elements are represented by corresponding lower letters and a pair of subscripts like $a_{i,j}$. The notation $A \in \mathbb{F}^{m \times n}$ means that $A$ is a matrix of $m$ rows and $n$ columns:
$$A \in \mathbb{F}^{m \times n} \Leftrightarrow A = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{1,1} & \cdots & a_{1,n} \\
 \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{m,1} & \cdots & a_{m,n} \\
\end{bmatrix};\quad a_{1,1},\ldots,a_{m,n}\in \mathbb{F}$$

The conjugates of scalars, vectors and matrices are all represented by a bar above like $\bar{\alpha}$, $\bar{\vec{x}}$ and $\bar{A}$. The transpositions of vectors and matrices are represented by superscript $T$ like $\vec{x}^T$ and $A^T$. The conjugate transpositions of vectors and matrices are represented by superscript * like $\vec{x}^*$ and $A^*$.

For example, the vector $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$ can be $\vec{x} = [0, 1, 2]^T$; the matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}^{2 \times 3}$ can be
$$A =  \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & \mathrm{i} \\
-1+2\mathrm{i} & -\mathrm{i} & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

Sub-matrix of matrix $A$ is represented by $A_{i_{1}:i_{2},j_{1}:j_{2}}$ which means that $A$'s row from $i_{1}$ to $i_{2}$ and column from $j_{1}$ to $j_{2}$ (both inclusive) are taken to form a new sub-matrix. Sometimes, part of matrix $A$'s row or column will be taken when I use the notation like $\vec{a}_{:,j}$ (take all elements of $A$'s column $j$ as a new vector).

The diagonal of matrix $A$ is a vector formed by $\left\{ a_{i,i} \right\}$ for all $i$, which is represented by $\text{diag}\ \!{A}$. Its $k$-diagonal is a vector formed by $\left\{ a_{i,i + k} \right\}$ for all $i$, which is represented by $\text{diag}_k{A}$.

The inner product of both vectors $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ in field $\mathbb{F}^{m}$ is represented by $\left\langle \vec{x},\vec{y} \right\rangle$:
$$\left\langle \vec{x},\vec{y} \right\rangle := \sum_{i = 1}^{m}{{\bar{x}}_{i}y_{i}}$$
which is
$$\left\langle \vec{x},\vec{y} \right\rangle = \vec{x}^* \vec{y}$$

The vector $\vec{x}$'s norm is represented by $\left\| \vec{x} \right\|$:
$$\left\| \vec{x} \right\| := \sqrt{\left\langle \vec{x},\vec{x} \right\rangle}$$

The eigen decomposition of matrix $A \in \mathbb{F}^{m \times m}$ is the matrices formed by all the eigenvalues $\lambda_{i}$ and eigenvectors ${\vec{u}}_{i}$ that follow
$$A\vec{u}_i = \lambda_i\vec{u}_i$$
The diagonal matrix $\Lambda = \text{diag}\left\{ \lambda_{1},\ldots,\lambda_{m} \right\}$ and column vector matrix $U = \left\lbrack {\vec{u}}_{i},\ldots,{\vec{u}}_{m} \right\rbrack$ thus have relation
$$A = U\Lambda U^{-1}$$
in eigen decomposition. As for non-Hermitian matrix $A$, there may exist vector $\vec{v}$ such that $\vec{v}^* A = \lambda\vec{v}^*$ and $\vec{v} \neq \vec{u}$. The column vector matrix $V = \left\lbrack {\vec{v}}_{i},\ldots,{\vec{v}}_{m} \right\rbrack$ is then called the left eigenvectors while $U$ is called the right eigenvectors. I will not dive any deeper in the left eigenvector(s) in this note: If the left ones are required or the left linear system $\vec{x}^* A = \vec{b}^*$ is to be solved, you can simply conjugate transpose $A$.

The matrix $A$'s norm is defined by the magnitude of its eigenvalue with largest magnitude, which is represented by $\left\| A \right\|$. It can be proved with simple operations that
$$\left\| A \right\| := \max_{\left\| \vec{x} \right\| = 1}\left\| A\vec{x} \right\|$$

The iteration number is usually at subscript without any brackets like ${\vec{q}}_{n}$. Sometimes, since the subscripts are preserved by the sub-matrix or sub-vector notations, the iteration number will be at superscript with bracket like $\vec{q}^{(n)}$.
